    CLEAN AIR
    IN INDIA
    G      lobally, air pollution is a silent
           killer. The air pollution levels
    in India are among the highest in
    the world, posing a heavy threat to
    the country's health and economy.
    Almost all of India’s 1.4 billion people
    are exposed to unhealthy levels of
    ambient PM 2.5 – the most harmful
    pollutant - emanating from multiple
    sources. These small particulates with
    a diameter of less than 2.5 microns,
    is about one-thirtieth the width of a
    human hair. Exposure to PM 2.5 can
    cause such deadly illnesses as lung
    cancer, stroke, and heart disease.
    Ambient and indoor air pollution is
    estimated to have caused 1.7 million
    premature deaths in India in 2019.
    The health impacts of pollution
    also represent a heavy cost to the
    economy. Lost labor income due to
    fatal illness from PM 2.5 pollution
    in 2017 was in the range of $30-78
    billion, equal in magnitude to about
    0.3-0.9 percent of the country’s GDP.

    PM 2.5 comes from a variety of
    sources. Some of the most common
    sources include emissions from
    burning fossil fuels such as coal or oil
    and biomass such as wood, charcoal,
    or crop residues. PM 2.5 can also

      The Government of India’s National Clean Air Program (NCAP)
      is a powerful step in acknowledging and resolving the problem
                             of deteriorating ambient air quality.

Shifting gears towards
services-led development
•	   New services economy has created an opportunity to
     move away from the traditional manufacturing-led
     growth model toward a services-led development model.
•	   Countries in South Asia have a strong comparative
     advantage in exporting services, particularly business
     processes and tourism
•	   Digital technologies make services more tradable
     and enable services to increase productivity of other
     sectors—including manufacturing. Digital platforms
     open new markets for firms.




Policy options
•	   Rethink regulations and establish new institutions.
•	   Lower entry barriers to create more national and
     international competition, while preventing the
     emergence of new monopoly powers.
•	   Enable increased mobility in labor markets, while
     encouraging upgrading of skills, both through education
     and on-the job training.
•	   Facilitate the absorption of the new services, both by
     firms and households.

       In the first years of life, all children need healthy food, a
       clean environment, and stimulation to thrive and reach
       their full developmental potential. However, poverty
       prevents millions of young children in low- and middle-
       income countries from receiving adequate nutrition and
       stimulation. As a result, many disadvantaged children’s
       brain development lags behind that of their well-off peers,
       which can have lifelong consequences. Previous research
