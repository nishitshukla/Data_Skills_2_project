    from the front

    W      omen constitute half of India’s population, but have not benefitted proportionately from the
           country's economic prosperity. The pandemic has seen more women affected because of the
    informal nature of their work. But they have not given up. From across the country have emerged stories
    of resilient women, coming out of their homes and helping communities with immense strength and
    courage. They have turned the pandemic into a positive experience, tailoring their skills to fit the new
    world. These stories offer hope and encouragement for others to follow.

     Chennai becomes first Indian city to
     recycle wastewater at scale
     By Poonam Ahluwalia, Raghu Kesavan

     Much thought has been given to Chennai’s water woes.
     Now, taking a leaf from Singapore’s acclaimed initiative,
     the city has begun to recycle wastewater at scale to
     meet the non-drinking water needs of its industries. Its
     two Tertiary Treatment Reverse Osmosis (TTRO) plants
     - launched in late 2019 - are the first facilities of this
     nature and scale in India.

     Making roads safer for India’s popular
     two-wheelers
     Jaishree Jindel, Gerald Ollivier

     In India two-wheelers – motorbikes and scooters -
     remain the first choice for upwardly mobile families
     and young commuters as they buy their first motorized
     vehicles. Unfortunately, two-wheelers are more prone to
     accidents than cars, and riders suffer a high rate of death
     and disability. Measures introduced in other countries
     and in other parts of India can provide useful lessons for
     the country’s plans to enhance road safety.

Road crashes affect women and men
differently—here’s why
Wei Yan, Dr. Soames Job

Traffic collisions claim 1.35 million lives every year—a
number that has been widely publicized. But the global
statistics on road safety hide many disparities when it
comes to the geographic distribution of victims, their
socioeconomic profile, and, perhaps more surprisingly,
their gender.

5 reasons why South Asia is coming
together to beat marine plastic
pollution
By Cecile Fruman, John Roome, Pawan Patil

Plastic pollution is everywhere - in the air we breathe,
in glacial ice on Mount Everest, in water we drink and
in fish that we eat, with huge costs to the environment,
biodiversity, livelihoods, and even our health.
Interventions are needed at every stage of the plastic
lifecycle, from production to stopping plastic leakage
through investments in solid waste management, to
transitioning to a circular economy approach for plastics.

     REPORT

     Traffic Crash Injuries and Disabilities: The Burden on Indian Society

     February 2021

     Road crashes endanger the lives and livelihoods of millions of road users globally and in India. The risk
     of a road crash in low-income countries is three times higher compared to that in high-income countries.
     Not only does it lead to untold and unaccounted for suffering and loss for victims and their families, it
     also drains the GDP of countries by claiming millions of economically productive young lives. The World
     Bank commissioned a survey-based assessment study in association with the Save LIFE Foundation
     (SLF) to determine such differential impacts more objectively in India. This study aims to capture the
     socioeconomic realities and nuances of road crashes at the sub-national level in India. It seeks
     to document inter-linkages between poverty, inequalities, road users, and road crash
     outcomes by analyzing data from four States in India, i.e., Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu,
     and Maharashtra.




     Strengthening Teacher Mentoring and Monitoring Systems: Evidence from India
     - Implications for Teacher Development: Strengthening Teacher Mentoring and
     Monitoring Systems: Evidence from India (English)

     March 2021

     Over the last 10 years, a special cadre of middle-level management known as Resource Persons (RPs) was
     specifically created in India for carrying out teacher mentoring and monitoring activities. Despite being
     allocated almost one-third of the education budget targeted at improving learning outcomes, the RPs are a
     poorly understood cadre with little known about their roles, responsibilities and effectiveness. In this paper,
     drawing on detailed data collected from school audits, unannounced classroom observations, student,
     teacher and RP surveys in approximately 350 primary and upper primary schools in Jharkhand, India,
     authors assess RPs’ mentoring and monitoring activities.
