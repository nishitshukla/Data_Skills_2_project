that are not climate friendly will be costlier to finance.




In conclusion
So yes, infrastructure spending will have growth multipliers. It will depend on
whether these investments are financed by leveraging financial markets and
undertaken by creditworthy infrastructure companies. While technocratically
possible, the implementation of this approach will require active political
shepherding. Prices will have to be restructured; roles and responsibilities between
tiers of governments reimagined; and public policies shaped to leverage markets.
The availability of a new social protection architecture, a global class IT system,
and India’s past and on-going experience in infrastructure management offers the
capacity for India to unleash a rethinking of how infrastructure can be delivered at
scale. Climate considerations further add to this imperative.

Ultimately, India needs a new class of infrastructure companies modelled as
modern utilities under company law capable of accessing financial markets to
accompany any infrastructure stimulus from GoI.

In this context, the next generation of DFIs can play a critical role.

     Vaccinating 2 billion and beyond in India
     A year after its launch, India had administered 1.5 bn doses of a
     COVID-19 vaccine by January 2022. Vaccine hesitancy in India appears
     to be a smaller problem than elsewhere in the world. But vaccinating
     the next billion will require reaching a poorer segment of the
     population, for whom the main barriers to vaccine access may include
     knowledge, awareness, proximity and convenience. A greater focus on
     these aspects of last-mile service delivery may offer the key to bringing
     the pandemic one step closer to its conclusion.

     The hidden $1 trillion: Halting waste
     in public procurement
     Governments today spend an estimated $13 trillion each year on
     public contracts for goods, services and public works . As much as a
     quarter of that is wasted in inefficient or shortsighted procurement
     practices. Halting the waste could free up at least $1 trillion a year

What will it take to connect the

Long delays at the borders contribute to the high costs of trade
between the countries of the BBIN sub-region - Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, and Nepal. These are largely due to the inadequate infrastructure
at border crossings, a plethora of paper-based procedures, restrictive
policies and regulations, and inefficient logistics for cargo handling.

improved accessibility, particularly in
hilly areas, increased access to economic

What Do We Know about Poverty in India in 2017/18	
 This paper describes several methods to estimate poverty in India in 2017. India is likely the country with the largest
number of people living below the international poverty line of $1.90 and its latest publicly available household survey
dates to 2011/12, giving rise to considerable uncertainty over the recent trend in global poverty. The authors use a
range of methods to derive a poverty estimate for India in 2017 which can be incorporated in the global poverty counts.
