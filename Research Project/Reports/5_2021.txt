    HOW TO
    VACCINATE
    EVERY COUNTRY
    DAVID MALPASS


    The current approach to COVID-19 vaccination – using limited vaccine supplies to
    protect low-risk populations in a handful of countries while low- and middle-income
    economies wait indefinitely for doses – doesn’t make sense for anyone. A successful
    global vaccination effort must be equitable, and it must stand on three pillars.

This illogical approach – using limited vaccine
supplies in a handful of countries while low- and

– doesn’t make sense for anyone. More lives will be
lost, global economic growth will be more unequal,
and even countries with high vaccination rates will be
more at risk from novel coronavirus variants than they
would be if developing countries had greater access
to vaccines. The longer it takes to achieve broad
vaccination of the vulnerable, the higher the risk of
extreme poverty in 2021 and 2022, which in turn will
invite future health and social crises.

#YOUTHSPEAK
The World Bank Group and the Financial Times jointly conducted a blog writing
competition for high school students. In the context of COVID-19, students were
asked to provide ideas and solutions to improve education outcomes. High school
students from around the world (more than 400 students from 62 countries),
from different social, cultural and economic backgrounds wrote about how their
experience of learning was affected during COVID-19 and shared their ideas about
how to improve the learning experience and make it more impactful.


Shirin Rajesh from India, was one among the winners.
