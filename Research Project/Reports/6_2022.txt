                1980s
       Following global oil shocks, as India sought indigenous sources of energy, the
        World Bank supported the development of oil and gas extraction facilities at
        Bombay High and the Cambay Basin, and assisted with the exploration of
                  hydrocarbon reserves in the Krishna Godavari Delta.
           With the advent of containerized cargo, projects also supported the
       development of India’s largest container port at Nhava Sheva near Mumbai.

       South Asia Economic Focus: Spring 2022



          Reshaping Norms
          A New Way Forward

      T
              he uneven recovery from the
              pandemic has left countries in
              South Asia with multiple policy
      challenges, exacerbated by the impact
      of the war in Ukraine. While several
      countries are navigating rising inflation
      and growing difficulties to finance fiscal
      deficits and trade deficits, the region must
      also chart a new way forward to address
      rising inequality, accommodate an energy
      transition, and unleash new growth
      potential. To reshape their economies,
      the region cannot avoid redesigning tax
      systems, increasing competition, and
      challenging vested interests and existing
      gender norms. This issue of the South
      Asia Economic Focus describes recent
      economic developments, analyzes the
      economic impact on South Asia of the
      war in Ukraine, presents growth forecasts,
      provides risk scenarios, and concludes that
      reshaping economies goes hand in hand
      with reshaping norms.

R
       ussia’s invasion of
       Ukraine and its effects
       on commodity markets,
supply chains, inflation, and
financial conditions have
steepened the slowdown in
global growth. One key risk to
the outlook is the possibility of
high global inflation accompanied
by tepid growth, reminiscent of the
stagflation of the 1970s. This could
eventually result in a sharp tightening
of monetary policy in advanced
economies, which could lead to
financial stress in some emerging
market and developing economies.
A forceful and wide-ranging policy
response is required to boost growth,
bolster macroeconomic frameworks,
reduce financial vulnerabilities
