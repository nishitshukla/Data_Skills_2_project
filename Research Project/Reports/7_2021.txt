     Glaciers of the Himalayas: Climate Change,
     Black Carbon, and Regional Resilience
     Muthukumara Mani

     This report investigates the extent to which the Black Carbon (BC) reduction
     policies of South Asian countries may affect glacier formation and melt within the
     context of a changing global climate. It assesses the relative impact of each source
     of BC on snow and glacier dynamics. The authors simulate how BC emissions
     interact with projected climate scenarios, estimate the extent to which these
     glacial processes affect water resources in downstream areas of these river basins,
     and present scenarios until 2040.

     Lessons in Investment Promotion:
     The Case of Invest India
     Phillips, Joe Heilbron, Armando Kher, Priyanka

     Prior to 2009, India did not have a national dedicated organization with a specific
     mandate to promote and facilitate FDI. Invest India, established in 2009 has in
     part, contributed to India’s stellar FDI performance in 2020. While some challenges
     remain, Invest India’s journey provides valuable learnings for other investment
     promotion agencies (IPAs), which in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, will need to
     be in a period of review and reform.

     The underlying premise of Green Roads is therefore
     quite simple: designing roads to fit their natural and

     landscape, and soil resources will usually cost less than
     traditional protective resilience approaches and will
     produce more sustainable overall outcomes.
